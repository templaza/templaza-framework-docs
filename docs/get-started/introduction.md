## The Launch!
Astroid Framework v1.0 was born in 2018 and built by JoomDev, a long-time well-known Joomla team of talented developers. In 2021 they decided to release this beautifully crafted framework to Open Source (Like Joomla). Their last release was v2.5.4 (32 releases in all).

Templaza, another well-known Joomla & WordPress team of developers, works with Joomdev to develop Astroid and bases their own Joomla templates on the Astroid framework. When release to Open Source, Templaza decided to carry the torch to the future.

In 2023, Templaza (and the growing community) released more than 20 new versions, enhancing this already great Framework and doing so regularly.
