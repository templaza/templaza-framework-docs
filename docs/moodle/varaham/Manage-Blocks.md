# Managing blocks - General information

Blocks are a type of content items, similar to resources. They are used to provide an overview of the course itself or enhance your core course content. They can be added to the Dashboard and to special Moodle block positions.

[More information on blocks is available at the official Moodle Docs.](https://docs.moodle.org/402/en/Blocks)

## Adding Moodle blocks to the footer
`If you add any block at an admin page or at the Moodle Dashboard, it can only be displayed within this context and not throughout the entire site - but that's what you would like for the footer blocks.
  So at first you should return to the Moodle Site Home.`

- Enable Edit mode in the top left of the page.
- Scroll down to the footer section at the bottom of the page.
- Click the "Add a block" button at one of the footer's block positions.
- Select the calendar block in the following menu.

## Blocks within courses

With Varaham, you have the option to position Moodle blocks before or after your Moodle course content. A course instructor can use this to create useful course information blocks or contents to enhance the course design.

The "Top Block Position" and the "Bottom Block Position" are available for the main course page as well as for the Moodle "Page" and "Book" resource type.
