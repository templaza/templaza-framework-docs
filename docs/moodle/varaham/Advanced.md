1. Theme preset: 	A preset is a file designed to be added to the theme and provides pre-defined layouts and styles. Currently, the following presets are available:
   - default: Default styling for Varaham
   - legacy: Provides some designs and styles that ensure compatibility with the previous version of Varaham.
   
2. Custom SCSS: Whatever CSS rules you add to this textarea will be reflected in every page, making for easier customization of this theme.

3. Bootstrap 4 to Bootstrap 5 Converter: Moodle 5 is based on the Bootstrap 5 framework. By selecting the checkbox, you can automatically convert a large number of Bootstrap 4 classes and data attributes to their Bootstrap 5 counterparts. If you have already created content under Moodle 4 with the Lambda Content Editor plugin or have manually created components based on Bootstrap 4, then this option is useful for continuing to use your existing Bootstrap 4 components.
