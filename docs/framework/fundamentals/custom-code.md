# Custom Code

The Analytics tracking code is a snippet of JavaScript that collects and sends data to Analytics from a website.

The Analytics tracking code may be directly added directly to the HTML of each page on your site, or indirectly using a tag management system such as Google Tag Manager.

Please go to **Admin > Theme Options > Settings > Custom Code**

## Custom CSS/JS

For all customization purposes, this framework allows you to load multiple CSS/JS files you customized without altering the template core files.

You can include css/js files by adding file path per line. You can use Full URL of the CSS/JS file, or path of the CSS/JS file relative to the Joomla root directory.
