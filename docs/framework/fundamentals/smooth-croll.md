# Smooth Scroll

Enabling smooth scroll is to make sure the anchor tags within the page scroll smoothly.

You can also control the speed at which the scroll will happen. This is a very useful option for creating one-page websites.

Please go to **Admin > Theme Options > Settings > General > Smooth Scroll**
