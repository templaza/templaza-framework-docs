# Footer For Multilingual Site

This instruction might be helpful for people who are planning to buil a multilingual site. Ex: You'd like to create a multilingual site in English and Italian. Here below is an example with Autobike theme. You can follow the instruction to build a multilingual footer for other themes.

## Create a footer for the second language

Please go to **Theme Options > Footers > Duplicate** a current footer or you can create a new footer > Rename it and you can edit the footer content in the other languages. So we have one footer for English and one footer for Italian. (English is the default language).


![Footer](./img/footer-language.avif)

## Create templates for the second language

After creating a footer for the second language (Italian), you should go to **Theme Options > Templates > Duplicate** current templates > rename them. Then edit those templates one by one, and assign them to the footer for the second language. 

Ex: We have: 

* Autobike Home 1 EN and Autobike Home 1 IT
* Autobike Inventory EN and Autobike Inventory IT

![Footer](./img/footer-multi.avif)

You should assign templates EN to the Autobike Footer EN, and template IT to the Autobike Footer IT.

## Edit pages and choose a template style

After having Footers and templates created in the second language, you should go to Pages > edit your pages > Choose TemPlaza style accordingly. 

Ex: Edit the Home EN > and assign it to the templaza style "Autobike Home 1 EN".

Edit the Home IT > and assign it to the templaza style "Autobike Home 1 IT".

You should do the same with other pages. 

![Page](./img/page-it.avif)

Assign the home IT to the home template IT.
