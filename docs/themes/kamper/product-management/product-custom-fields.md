# Product's Field Groups

Field groups are created to attach fields to product articles. Each field group contains a title, Slug, Parent Custom Field Group, Description, and Branch Assignment.

## Creating a new field group

Go to Advanced Products > Field Group > Click **Add New** buttons to create your first field group. Next, give the field group a relevant and descriptive title, such as "About This Tent", "Amenities", "Campsite Rules",

About the Branch Assignment, you need to assign the custom field groups to available branches. If you don't assign each custom field group to a tour type, custom fields will not be displayed properly in the front-end.
