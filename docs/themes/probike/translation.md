# Translation

Probike is ready to translate by using the po file. If you want to build a multilingual site, you need to use the WPML plugin. Our theme does not include the WPML plugin. It is only compatible with the WPML plugin. You have to buy a license for this plugin.

## Using Po File

We suggest that you should install Loco translate plugin. Please read the guide document for detail here: [Loco Translate.](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/)

Here below are some common words that you may ask for translation.

## Translate Rental Units: Day, Month, Week, and Night

To change Day, Month, Week, and Night, you should go to Advanced Products > Custom Fields > Edit Rental Units (Protected field) > Choices > Change the rental units after the ":"
You shouldn't change the rental value before ":"

About the word "All", you should go to Loco Translate plugin > plugins > TemPlaza Framework > Install your language > Search and translate the word
