# Blog Data

In this section, we will discuss the creation of blog posts and all the available options for each post, setting up pages to display blog listings, as well as how to change the date format for your posts.


## Blog Posts

To create a new blog post, go to Posts > Add New from your WordPress admin panel. First, you need to enter a title for your blog post in the text field near the top of the screen. Then choose a format for your blog post in the Post Format section on the right side of the screen.

Let's take a look at the available blog post formats:

* **Standard** - This is the default blog format. You can start adding content with the default WordPress content editor or the Elementor Page Builder.
* **Gallery** - This format features an image gallery slider. After choosing the gallery format, you should scroll down along the right sidebar, you'll see Post Format Data to upload gallery images.

Now it's time to categorize this post:

1. Beneath the Format section, you will see a section named Categories. Here you can select the categories that you would like to add this post to. If you would like to create a new category, click on the + Add New Category link. A text field will appear in which you can enter a category name, and then click Add New Category.
2. Once you've selected the categories you would like to add your post to, click the Publish button. Congratulations, you've just published your first blog post!
3. Beneath the Categories section, you will see the Tags and Featured Image sections. Here you can add tags to your post and set a featured image which will be displayed for this post on blog list pages.
