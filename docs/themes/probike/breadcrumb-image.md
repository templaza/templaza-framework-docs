# Breadcrumb Image

On some pages such as **History, Team, Service, Gallery**, or About Us you can see the breadcrumb section having a background image.

![Breadcrumb](./img/breadcrumb.avif)

Those mentioned pages are assigned to the Probike Image Breadcrumb template. So to change this background image:

* You should go to **Probike Options > Templates > Probike Image Breadcrumb > Layout.**
* Edit the **Breadcrumb section > Design Settings tab >** Change the background image.

![Breadcrumb](./img/breadcrumb-layout.avif)

![Breadcrumb](./img/breadcrumb-design.avif)

## Create different breadcrumb images on various pages

In case you're not fond of having the same breadcrumb image on many pages, just read my below suggestion. 

You should duplicate a template into many versions, and edit the breadcrumb images of those duplicated ones. 

Go to Pages > Edit your pages > Assign a page to a corresponding template by choosing a TemPlaza style.
