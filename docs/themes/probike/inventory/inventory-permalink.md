# Change Inventory Permalink

## Change Inventory Permalink

To change the permalink of the Inventory page, you can go to Wp-admin > Settings > Permarlinks > Optional > Edit Advanced Product archive slug.

![Inventory](./img/slug.avif)

Then go to Appearance > Menus > Edit the main menu > Toggle Inventory menu item > Change the custom link according to the newly changed slug above. 

Ex: If the Advanced Product archive slug is: bikes
So the inventory URL should be: http://www.yourdomain.com/bikes

![Inventory](./img/inventory-url.avif)
