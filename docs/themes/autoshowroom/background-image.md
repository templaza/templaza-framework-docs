You should edit both the layout in the Settings and templates as well. Pages on your website are assigned to a specific template, so you need to edit the corresponding one to see changes. 

## How to assign a template to a page

You should go to Pages > edit a page > on the right sidebar, you can see an option "TemPlaza Style"
Here you can see or choose the template style assigned to a page. If a page is not assigned to a specific template, it will be inherited the layout from the theme's Settings.
