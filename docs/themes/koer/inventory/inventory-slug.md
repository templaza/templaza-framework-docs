# Change Inventory Permalink

## Change Inventory Permalink

To change the "ap-product" in each advanced product URL (ex: https://yourdomain/ap-product/product-1/), you can go to Wp-admin > Settings > Permalinks > Optional > Edit Advanced Product archive slug.

![Inventory](./img/url-setting.avif)

Then go to Appearance > Menus > Edit the main menu > Toggle Inventory menu item > Change the custom link according to the newly changed slug above. 

Ex: If the Advanced Product archive slug is: inventory
So the inventory URL should be: http://www.yourdomain.com/inventory

![Inventory](./img/url-menu.avif)
