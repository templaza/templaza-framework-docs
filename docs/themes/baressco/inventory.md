# Inventory

> This page is not included in the page list because it is created by a custom link.


## Create Inventory menu

* Please go to WP-admin > Appearance > Menu > Edit the main menu
* Add a custom link to the menu
* Insert `/ap-product/ after your domain`, then the inventory page will automatically appear in the front-end

Ex: your domain is http://abc.com, then the custom link should be http://abc.com/ap-product
