> You can refer to the [Event Calendar documentation](https://theeventscalendar.com/knowledgebase/product/the-events-calendar/) for detailed instruction.

## Events Assignment

When you have already had the Event data ready, you're supposed to go to Amanus Options > Settings > Settings > Events Options > Here you can assign the Event Archive style and Events Single Style to a template you want. 

If you leave them blank, event pages will be displayed with the default layout with a sidebar.

## Add the event page to the Primary Menu

Event page is a kind of archive page, so you couldn't find the event page on the page list. To add the event page to the Primary Menu, you're supposed to add a custom link: 

* Url: yourdomain/events
* Link text: enter the page title
