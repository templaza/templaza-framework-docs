## Edit the footer content

### 1.Home Pages' Footer

Please go to Admin > Agruco Options > Templates > Edit Home page / Home 2 / Home 3 > Layout

* Home page template is assigned to Home version 1
* Home 2 template is assigned to Home version 2
* In the layout section, you're supposed to scroll down to edit the Footer elements.

Home 3 template is assigned to Home version 3

### 2.Inner pages' footer

Inner pages are assigned to other prebuilt templates: Inventory, Full-width, No Sidebar, and Shop

First, you should check which template the page is assigned to. (By editing a page, check "Templaza options" to find out which template style your page is assigned to.) 

Ex: Service page is assigned to Full-width template, so you're supposed to edit the layout of this template, then changes will reflect properly in front-end.

## How to have the same footer on all pages without editing different templates

In this case, you should edit the footer content of a template (ex: Home page template), then click **"Save Section"** 

After that, the Footer section will be saved as a sample in the template library

When editing a footer of other templates, you can click add new section > Select the save Footer section in library. This step will save a lot of time

## Copyright

This section allows you to display your own copyright information that usually appears in the footer bottom of every website.
