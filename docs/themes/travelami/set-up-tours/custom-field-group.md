# Tour Custom Field Group

Field groups are created to attach fields to tour articles. Each field group contains a title, Slug, Parent Custom Field Group, Description, and Tour Type Assignment.

## Creating a New Field Group

Go to Tours  > Field Group > Click Add New buttons to create your first field group. Next, give the field group a relevant and descriptive title, such as “Tour Info” or “Tour Map”.

About the Tour Type Assignment, you need to assign the custom field group to one or more tour types. If you don't assign the custom field group to a tour type, custom fields will not be displayed properly in each tour post.
