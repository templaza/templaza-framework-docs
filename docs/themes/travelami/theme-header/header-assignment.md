# Header Assignment

![Header](./img/header-list.avif)

As you can see the Home 2 is assigned to Header 2, while Home 3 is assigned to the Header 3. And the rest is inherited the Travelami Default Header. 

For example, you choose the home 2 as the front home page, you need to edit and make changes in the Travelami Header 2 and the Travelami default. So the home page presents the Header 2 style, while the inner pages have the default header.

## How to make a header to become default

You can edit a header and enable the default option or from the header listing like above, you can click on the star icon to mark a header to be default.
