# Translation

## Enable a mega menu

To translate the theme, I suggest you use the Loco plugin. This plugin can help you do all things easily.

Please read the guide document for detail here: [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/). Below are some common words and phrases you may ask for translation (Mostly relating to Advanced products).

**Translate "From:", "/Person", "Not", "Book This Tour", "Total:", "Number" (Booking form)**

You should go to Loco Translate > Themes > Travelami > Add a new language > Choose system location  `languages/themes/travelami-{locale}.po`

Search and translate the word

**Translate "Tours Available", "Sort By", "Date: Newest First", "Date: Oldest First", "Title: A - Z", "Title: Z - A, "Price: High To Low", "Price: Low To High"** 

You should go to Loco Translate > Themes > Travelami > Add a new language > Choose system location  `languages/themes/travelami-{locale}.po`

**Translate "All" in the sidebar filter**
